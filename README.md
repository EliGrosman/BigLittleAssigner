# BigLittleAssigner
A system that intuitively assigns bigs and littles for fraternities and sororities. This project is still a work in progress.

# How to use
Create two csv files in the data directory. One for the littles and one for the bigs.
In the littles' csv file, each row is a little and each entry is how they rated the big that corresponds to that column
In the bigs' csv file, each row is a big and each entry is how they rated the little that corresponds to that column
Then run the main script.
